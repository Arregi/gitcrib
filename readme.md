### This is a git command cheatsheet in markdown format

### How to use it
Each file is named after a git command, the template provides information on how the file sections are structured so you can use it to easily add more commands to the project. 

This will be a tedious work, so any help is welcomed.

Github automatically orders files alphabetically so there is no need for an index, use the search or simply trawl the main folder.

I am planning on separating porcelain commands from plumbing commands in different branches, let me know what you think about this.

### Why?
There is plenty of cheatsheets out there so why?

* Man pages do not take advantage of syntax highlighting.
* I wanted to try another structure for a cheatsheet.
* You can clone this repository and use cat filename.md from within your preferred terminal.


### Version

I am now using git 2.7.2.windows.1 so all of the testing is done with this version of git.
